### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app)

- [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - Came pre-installed with Create Next App

### What I learned

Through working on this project, I was able to learn the basics of Next.js, the server-side framework for React. In addition to this, I also got some experience working with React's Context API. Context was used to persist the theme throughout the pages.
