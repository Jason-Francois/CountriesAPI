## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- [Create Next App] (https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - Came pre-installed with Create Next App


### What I learned
Through working on this project, I was able to learn the basics of Next.js, the server-side framework for React. In addition to this, I also got some experience working with React's Context API. Context was used to persist the theme throughout the pages.
